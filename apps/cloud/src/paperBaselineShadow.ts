/**
 * Uncensored shadow of the owner baseline rule (SMA 5/20 on completed minute closes). It follows the SAME completed-minute bars the
 * PAPER strategy reads and applies the baseline's own BUY/SELL rule to a hypothetical single position, whether or not Risk would have
 * let a real order through. So when the consecutive-loss halt blocks every BUY, the shadow still produces the round trips the rule
 * would have made, with fees, and the PAPER ledger (which a halt censors) is not the only source of evidence.
 *
 * It is display and analysis only: it places no order, writes no ledger, creates no fill, and feeds no Risk, Governance or
 * Research decision. Its totals are NOT PAPER evidence and must never be promoted as such.
 * Persisted state is the totals and the last processed minute per market; an open hypothetical position is NOT persisted, so a
 * restart drops it (the shadow is then flat and re-enters on the next bar the rule says BUY).
