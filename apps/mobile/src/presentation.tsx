/**
 * Presentation boundary for the mobile app.
 *
 * App.tsx imports every screen presenter, shared primitive and theme provider from here and
 * nowhere else (enforced by tests/mobile-presentation-boundary.test.js). Screen presenters receive
 * already-derived screen models (for example buildHomeFieldInput, buildPaperFieldHeader,
 * buildLiveFieldHeader) and design tokens (designSystem.ts: fieldPalette, fieldMotion; fieldFonts),
 * so a future redesign replaces presenters here without touching data, safety or navigation.
 *
 * The current presenters are the "calm-v1" whole-app redesign (지금 · 기록 · 학습 · 안전). See docs/UI_ARCHITECTURE.md.
