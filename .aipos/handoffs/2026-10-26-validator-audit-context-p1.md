# PR #2772 successor handoff — review P1 repairs

## Current checkpoint — 2026-10-27

Protected main was freshly verified as `81e8fe4dc74572d934fa5cbaf724aeef43e591f1`. PR #2772 remains OPEN/Draft at remote head `1dc5e2e224946cb8dd950b776b13194ac98d4c9e`; GitHub reports base SHA `54cfb2199cee1fdbaf5ea328c8a0940f4101e723`. A clean isolated worktree contains a non-conflicting ordinary merge of current main plus repairs for P1 comments `4383248962` and `4383248970`.

The Validator now finds trusted package manifests only on the exact changed source path's ancestor chain (root to nearest), with bounded depth and fail-closed malformed/missing manifests. It resolves relative modules from the exact-head Git tree's blob entries only, so a directory cannot be mistaken for a contents listing; truncated/oversized trees fail before model invocation. Regression coverage includes a mobile-local React manifest, a directory with `index.ts`, and truncated-tree rejection.

Local Node 24.19.0 verification: build, typecheck, preflight, `validate:full`, `security:gate`, and `git diff --check` PASS; lint has 0 errors and 45 existing warnings; all 1,289 isolated test files PASS after adding installed Git Bash to PATH; focused validator runner 12/12 PASS. These are local prepublication results. No successor has been committed or published yet, so remote exact-head CI, fresh independent review, and Formal Validator are pending. Keep PR Draft, do not resolve author threads, and do not start Audit/Release/merge. Before publication, re-fetch main and PR metadata; publish only if the expected PR head and base contract still hold.

Safety remains PAPER_ONLY; liveAuthority=NONE; productionMutationAllowed=false; aiAuthority=ZERO_AUTHORITY. No Oracle host operation or deployment is authorized by this repair.

Fresh verification recorded PR #2772 at predecessor head 6bbe976f1ee544505caf80516cf15d9ee95ec35d, base/protected main 54cfb2199cee1fdbaf5ea328c8a0940f4101e723, OPEN / Draft / mergeable. CI 40408780055 and required companions passed. Fresh review receipt 5659781964 reported P1 comments 4383069772 and 4383069780:

- Deterministic Audit must require same consumer run/attempt trusted Audit evidence in addition to Validator evidence.
- Deleted changed source must be fetched from exact PR base for dependency analysis and marked with base provenance.

Both repairs and regressions are in the local successor. Node 24.19 preflight, build, focused tests, and diff check passed; remaining full local gates are pending. No commit or push has been made. Finish full validation, then re-fetch PR/main and publish only by non-force update if the remote head remains exactly 6bbe976f1ee544505caf80516cf15d9ee95ec35d.

Keep Draft. Do not resolve review threads as author, substitute this session for Formal Validator, or start Audit/Release/merge. PR #2877 ca2c4786... remains separately blocked on its already-running review; do not duplicate its request. Oracle remains read-only and not exact-main accepted.

Safety: PAPER_ONLY; liveAuthority=NONE; productionMutationAllowed=false; aiAuthority=ZERO_AUTHORITY.
