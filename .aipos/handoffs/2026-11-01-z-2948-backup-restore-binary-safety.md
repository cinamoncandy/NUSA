# CORE handoff — 2026-11-01 — Issue #2948

Scope: owner-authored P1 work order `WO-OPS-20261101-2948-BACKUP-RESTORE-BINARY-SAFETY` on branch `WO-OPS-20261101-2948-BACKUP-RESTORE-BINARY-SAFETY`, based on protected main `dc9e4758515792a683d2b234a3cf20eca1508ca9` at claim time. This follows the fresh implementation inventory after independent gates on #2975/#2973/#2955 and canonical WIP access for #1851 remained external waits.

## Confirmed issue and scope

Issue #2948 is OPEN, P1, authored by repository owner `cinamoncandy`, and has no existing open PR or matching implementation branch. The reported production snapshot is 1,306,017,792 bytes; its source checksum and SQLite `quick_check`/`integrity_check` passed, while `scripts/backup-restore.js backup` fails before manifest creation because `secretFindings` converts the entire file Buffer to one UTF-8 string. Fresh main still contains that implementation. Open #2877 changes the Oracle release helper/workflow and does not touch this script/test family.

The permitted change is limited to the existing backup/verify/verify-only drill path: bounded-memory byte copying, hashing, and secret scanning; exact manifest and source identity behavior; read-only `quick_check` and `integrity_check` on copied `DATABASE_SNAPSHOT` drill artifacts; deterministic regressions. Destructive restore stays unsupported. No host or Oracle operation, source DB write, evidence deletion, retention, deployment, restart, lease, LIVE, or financial authority change is permitted.

## Current execution

- Protected main at branch claim: `dc9e4758515792a683d2b234a3cf20eca1508ca9` (fresh `git ls-remote` at start).
- Canonical owner: `nusa-server-automation` for this isolated server backup scope.
- Branch: `WO-OPS-20261101-2948-BACKUP-RESTORE-BINARY-SAFETY`.
- Initial checkout: clean and exactly at claimed base.
- Dependency environment: fresh `corepack pnpm@11.7.0 install --frozen-lockfile`, lockfile unchanged, postinstall security backports PASS.
- First broken transition: large binary `DATABASE_SNAPSHOT` → bounded backup/verify/drill → integrity-checked copied SQLite file.
- Next: implement and test the bounded binary path. Keep PR Draft after local gates; require fresh exact-head CI and a fresh independent review before further governance.

## Validation update

- Bounded chunked SHA-256, secret scanning, stable-source copying, and read-only SQLite integrity checks are implemented in the existing backup/verify/drill path.
- Focused backup/restore suites: 58/58 PASS, including a 512 MiB sparse binary artifact above Node's maximum string length, chunk-boundary secret detection, copied SQLite checks, and malformed-database fail-closed cleanup.
- `pnpm run preflight`, `pnpm run typecheck`, `pnpm run validate:full`, and `pnpm run security:gate`: PASS.
- `pnpm run lint`: 0 errors, 47 warnings, equal to the recorded baseline; no warning from the changed test remains.
- `pnpm test`: PASS, 1323 isolated test files.
- `git diff --check`: PASS. The test runner removed a pre-existing tracked failure log as designed; the known original file was restored so this task does not alter that historical artifact.
- Security gate generated the dated dependency audit, secret scan, hardening report, and SBOM; retain these as validation artifacts.
- Still not committed or opened as a PR. Next: final scope/diff review, commit, one Draft PR for #2948, exact-head checks, and independent review. No merge, release, or host operation.

Safety remains `PAPER_ONLY`, `liveAuthority=NONE`, `productionMutationAllowed=false`, `realOrderAuthority=false`, `realTransferAuthority=false`, `aiAuthority=ZERO_AUTHORITY`.

## Exact-head review P1 follow-up — 2026-11-01

This section supersedes the earlier next-action statement above; that initial
handoff predates the opened PR and its review.

- PR #2948 remains OPEN / Draft / mergeable on exact head
  `e78b4162bda96de06e8170cb943b689b655b5d85`, based on
  `dc9e4758515792a683d2b234a3cf20eca1508ca9` at fresh PR inspection.
- Exact-head CI and all five companions were SUCCESS on that predecessor.
  Same-SHA Codex review summary `6556810301` completed with findings. The two
  current non-outdated P1 threads are `PRRT_kwDOTUbne86yZZ0r` (associate and
  skip only a verified `.sha256` sidecar; run SQLite checks on its database)
  and `PRRT_kwDOTUbne86yZZ0t` (avoid retaining every secret match for large
  credential-heavy artifacts). Neither thread was resolved by the author.
- Both repairs are now in the local detached worktree rooted at that exact
  head. The drill validates the exact sidecar text against the sibling
  database's manifest SHA and basename; an unpaired sidecar remains treated as
  a database and therefore fails closed. The scanner records a boolean and
  stops scanning after a match while the caller continues hashing the file.
- Added regressions for a paired SQLite/sidecar directory, unpaired sidecar
  rejection, and 32 MiB of repeated credential-shaped content under a 64 MiB
  child-process heap limit.
- Node 24.19.0 / pnpm 11.25.0 frozen install succeeded without lockfile edits.
  Focused backup suites passed 61/61; final `pnpm test` passed 1,323 isolated
  test files; typecheck, `validate:full`, security gate (0 secrets), lint
  (0 errors / 47 existing warnings), and diff check passed. The final full run
  was performed after correcting the test fixture so its dummy credential is
  assembled from fragments and not mistaken for a checked-in secret.
- AIPOS work order and state record these repairs and successor validation
  requirement. Generated security report changes and the test runner's
  incidental removal of `isolated-test-failure.txt` must be restored before
  staging. No commit or push has been made yet.

Next: fresh-verify current protected main and PR #2948 head/base/branch, inspect
the full diff (only `scripts/backup-restore.js`, its test, and AIPOS evidence
should change), restore generated artifacts to their tracked baseline, then
commit and push the repair to the existing PR branch. The old SHA's CI/review
becomes historical after commit. Obtain fresh exact-head CI/companions, then a
new non-author review; leave both findings threads unresolved for independent
adjudication. Keep Draft; no Validator, Audit, Release, merge, deployment, or
Oracle mutation is implied.

## Successor commit and exact-head checks — 2026-11-01

This update supersedes the preceding pre-commit next-action text.

- Repairs were committed to the existing PR branch as
  `bd09b6ad9929eb3adb57b7bb2578fbfa35fa51a9` and pushed to PR #2948. The PR
  remains OPEN / Draft / mergeable, based on protected main
  `dc9e4758515792a683d2b234a3cf20eca1508ca9` at fresh verification.
- The PR description now documents the two repaired review findings and local
  validation. The predecessor review and checks remain historical.
- Exact-head CI run `41299863980` and five companion runs `41299863849`,
  `41299863826`, `41299863928`, `41299863930`, and `41299864015` were all
  in progress at the latest fresh query. No successor review has been
  requested yet.

Next: wait for all six exact-head workflows to finish. If all pass, request one
fresh non-author review for `bd09b6ad9929eb3adb57b7bb2578fbfa35fa51a9` and
request independent adjudication of both P1 threads. If any check fails,
inspect its job/log and classify before changing code. Keep the PR Draft and
the threads unresolved. No Formal Validator, Audit, Release, merge, deploy,
Oracle mutation, or production operation is authorized by this update.
