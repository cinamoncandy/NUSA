- Shared view-model for truthful zero/unavailable formatting.
- Paper order confirmation before the existing IPC mutation command.
- Mobile/tablet/desktop responsive behavior through shared DOM and CSS.
- Advanced operations remain reachable through the existing legacy panels.

Deferred:

- Colors, branding, icons, animation, typography, decorative charts, and pixel-level design.
